It looks like this:,System.out.println("Enter numerical value");    
int option;
option = input.nextInt(); // Read numerical value from input
System.out.println("Enter 1st string"); 
String string1 = input.nextLine(); // Read 1st string (this is skipped)

When the user clicks the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for the result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the ListView activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget.

The image preview on the ListView is being done with the cursor and ListAdapter. This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the src for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.

The issue is that I get an OutOfMemoryError when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.

Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (bitwise)?
This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with the touch screen because of the focus issue. (I can use rollerball.)

I know I can do an out of band resize and save my image, but that is not really what I want to do, but some sample code for that would be nice.
As soon as I disabled the image on the ListView it worked fine again.

FYI: This is how I was doing it:,String[] from = new String[] { DBHelper.KEY_BUSINESSNAME, DBHelper.KEY_ADDRESS,
    DBHelper.KEY_CITY, DBHelper.KEY_GPSLONG, DBHelper.KEY_GPSLAT,
    DBHelper.KEY_IMAGEFILENAME  + ""};
int[] to = new int[] { R.id.businessname, R.id.address, R.id.city, R.id.gpslong,
    R.id.gpslat, R.id.imagefilename };
notes = new SimpleCursorAdapter(this, R.layout.notes_row, c, from, to);
setListAdapter(notes);

When we create a RecyclerView.Adapter we have to specify ViewHolder that will bind with the adapter.

Is it possible to create RecyclerView with multiple view types?,public class MyAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<MyAdapter.ViewHolder> {

    private String[] mDataset;

    public MyAdapter(String[] myDataset) {
        mDataset = myDataset;
    }

    public static class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {

            super(v);
            mTextView = v;
        }
    }

    @Override
    public MyAdapter.ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
        View v = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.some_layout, parent, false);

        //findViewById...

        ViewHolder vh = new ViewHolder(v);
